This is well crafted grid card design using flexbox. Highlights of this are:

- Solved the last row issue with flexbox where items are less than the number of columns. (For 3 columns).
- Images are cropped to aspect ratio of 16:9.
- Min and max width of the cards maintained. Also Min margin maintained.
- Dynamic resizing of cards, all cards take-up the height of the tallest card.
- Well calculated media queries.
- Works with IE11.
